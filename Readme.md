# Palindrome Problem 
This problem; in my opinion, is an basically an array reversal and comparison problem; since a word (or string) is an array of characters. 

The two methods use a form of array reversal and then compare the resulting reversed words. It is also important to ensure the words are all in same case (due to case sensitivity) to aid great comparison.

Tests available in the unit_test.py file. 

I also tried to stick to naming conventions and styles in python.

### To Do
- [ ] Implement Arg parser to make calling it a bit better for CLI. This ensures we do not need to access file to change variables
